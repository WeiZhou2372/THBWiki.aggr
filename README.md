R Shiny interactive interface

Aggregate search result from THBWiki, a Chinese version of Touhou Project source forage wiki-like website 

Currently support :

* search by Project (doujin circles)

* option to parse through proxy (for overseas users only)

* inspect listing before parsing (option has no effect)

* download aggregated result as structured html (thumbnails require network)

There is something I want to add or fix. Feel free to fork the code if you would like to help me:

* reactive interface (show button only when available)
* better progress indicator (stacking album art for instance)
* fix the problem of non-English text input (currently you can only copy and paste)
* automate proxy selection
* maybe multithreading
